    <h2>
     FIXML
    </h2>
    <p>
     The API itself doesn't have any business objects defined by the system back-end that contain the data necessary to make trades. Instead, FIX protocol messages are required, using a standard known as FIXML.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Ally Invest API supports order functionality for stock and option orders. Required order information is required to be submitted in FIXML format within the body of any order requests through the API. You can find sample orders in FIXML format to illustrate potential order messaging on the trading page. The current implementation relies on FIXML schema specification v 5.0 service pack 2, available for download at http://www.fixprotocol.org.
    </p>
    <p>
     Order support is included for basic stock and options orders as well as multi-leg support for complex option strategies such as spreads, straddles, covered calls, and iron condors. Support includes the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Equity market, limit, stop, stop limit, and market on close orders
     </li>
     <li>
      Single leg option orders can support market, limit, stop, and stop limit orders assuming the exchange accepting the order supports that order type
     </li>
     <li>
      Multi-leg support for advanced options strategies supporting market or limit price types
     </li>
     <li>
      Term qualifiers of "Day" for day orders or "GTC" for good until canceled orders for eligible
orders
     </li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Keep in mind that trailing stop orders are no longer supported. The following fields will cause an error if they are passed in the FIXML: Typ = "P" for trailing stop, ExecInst, OfstTyp, PegPxTyp, or OfstVal
    </p>
    <p>
     FIXML tag attributes are repeated in several of the examples shown on the trading page. The following table is a sample list of the attributes required along with a description.
