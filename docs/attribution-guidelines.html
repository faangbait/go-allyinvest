    <h3>
     Determining Whether Attribution is Required
    </h3>
    <p>
     If you are leveraging the Ally Invest API for the purposes of displaying data or information, link-back attribution is required. If you are leveraging the Ally Invest API to execute, or allow other users to execute, trades on the Ally Invest platform, we kindly request – but do not require – link-back attribution.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have any questions about whether you are providing proper attribution, feel free to send a screenshot to
     <a href="mailto:InvestAPI@ally.com">
      InvestAPI@ally.com
     </a>
     and we'll provide you with feedback.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Attribution Guidelines
    </h3>
    <p>
     Once it has been determined that attribution is required, please follow the guidelines below. Please note that any and all attribution links should be “followed” links.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Attribution Placement
    </h3>
    <p>
     The attribution should be placed in the same context as the data/information this is being displayed. In simple terms – please don’t bury the attribution statement in the footer of a page.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Attribution Content
    </h3>
    <p>
     The general attribution statement can be one of 2 variations:
    </p>
    <p>
     Powered by Ally Invest
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Powered by &lt;a href=http://www.ally.com/invest title=”Powered by Ally”&gt;Ally Invest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>
     Provided by Ally Invest
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Provided by &lt;a href=http://www.ally.com/invest title=”Powered by Ally”&gt;Ally Invest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>
     In both variations, the term Ally Invest should be clickable and link to
     <a href="/invest">
      http://www.ally.com/invest
     </a>
     .
