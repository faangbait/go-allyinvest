     Request Structure
    </h2>
    <h3>
     Overview
    </h3>
    <p>
     The request structure of an API is pretty simple for most calls. Most user and account-based brokerage calls can be made without a request body at all. We've done our best to make the API as restful as possible. This means that resources and their corresponding operations have an identifiable pattern to their use.
    </p>
    <p>
     While many of the calls are simply requests for information (GET) there are circumstances which require sending information (POST) or removing resources on the server (DELETE).
    </p>
    <p>
     For examples of each request, visit the specific page pertaining to the API call you are interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      We are exploring new ways to generate requests to our API. If you have a specific need for an alternate request format, let us know.
     </em>
    </p>
    <h3>
     Format
    </h3>
    <p>
     All requests made to the Ally Invest API must be valid HTTP requests sent over using the proper request method. For instance, a POST to create a new watchlist will include form parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
     *Note: Due to the complex nature of trade calls, we ask that you POST in FIXML to an order submission (or preview) operation.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Headers
    </h3>
    <p>
     For authenticated calls we require that you send over a valid
     <a class="internal present" href="oauth.html">
      OAuth
     </a>
     header. For unauthenticated requests, there aren't any required headers.
    </p>
    <h3>
     URI
    </h3>
    <p>
     Some requests require parameters within the URI. An example of this functionality as an accounts/:id/balances{.format} call. This call has multiple parameters handled on the command line. So to make a request to this operation your request URL would be:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
     <pre>https://devapi.invest.ally.com/v1/accounts/12345678/balances.json
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     Which would result in the balances response for account number 12345678 sent back in JSON format.
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
 </body>
</html>
